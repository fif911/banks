# Banks and Loans

## Description

This is a CLI simple application that allows you to create users, loans and administrate them via admin panel.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed

## How to make an executable

Install pyinstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`. Then, depending on your OS, run one of the following commands.
Note that PyInstaller supports making executables for Windows, Linux, and macOS, **but it cannot cross compile**. So, to
distribute executables for multiple types of OS, youâ€™ll need a build machine for each supported OS.

### Linux & MacOS

directory of the project.

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --name 'Bank Executable MacOS' main.py
```

After that, you will find an executable in the `dist` folder.

### Windows

To generate an executable for Windows, run:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name 'Bank Executable Windows' main.py
```

After that, you will find an executable in the `dist` folder.
